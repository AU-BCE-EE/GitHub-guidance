# Dealing with big files
GitHub warns when you try to push a large file, and at some point (currently 100 MB, see <https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-large-files-on-github>) blocks large files.
This document can list ways to deal with this problem.
