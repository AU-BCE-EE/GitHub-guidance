# Dealing with big files
GitHub warns when you try to push a large file, and at some point (currently 100 MB, see <https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-large-files-on-github>) blocks large files.

There are a couple different ways to work around this issue.
See points 6 and 8 in the [guidance-data-analysis repo README.md file](https://github.com/AU-BCE-EE/guidance-data-analysis).
