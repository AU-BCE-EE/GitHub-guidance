# Issues and discussions

Use GitHub issues through the "Issues" page for each repo to document and discuss any type of problem related to a repo you contribute to.
The basic idea (remember the code development roots of GitHub) is that an issue is identified, documented, and progress on addressing it is documented all under an issue.
You can tag contributors with `@`, other issues with `#`, and commits with the hash. 
Formatting of issues and discussions is in Markdown, which is a very simple "markup" language, meant to be clear whether viewed as plain text or after processing to an html or pdf file.
GitHub will display hmtl automatically, and go back to plain text for editing within the browser.
For example, this message:

```
We need to include info on Markdown somewhere in this guidance repo.
 
Here is a handy guide: https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/

From @J-Kamp 

See issue #9 as well.
```

will show up like this on the issues page:

For more on Markdown see the guidance document here.

Visibility of issues follows the repo in general but **it is good practice to think of discussion under issues as public**.

Why use GitHub Issues when you can just send a message by email or Teams?
Here are some reasons:

* Issues don't disappear or get lost, so you can add an issue and come back to it months later
* Issues provide a record of discussion and decisions, so repo creators can remember (and anyone can understand) why something was done a particular way 
* Tasks can be assigned to particular people 
* Once closed, issues are hidden and so don't clutter up your issues page, but are still saved and can be viewed or reopened

GitHub has something called "Discussions" which is similar to Issues but more for topics that don't really describe problems that need to be addressed.
Discussions need to be turned on for each repo for use.
