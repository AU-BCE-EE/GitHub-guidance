# Changing a repo name (moving a repo)

It is not unusual to need to change a repo name at some point after creating it.
Repo owners can change the name of a repo through the Settings option that can be found near the top of the repo main page:

Although the old URLs will still work, it is safer to update URLs wherever they are used.
Your local version of Git should still look for the correct location to find repo files even after the change, but here too it is better to use the correct URL.
Apparently the Windows GitHub Desktop interface automatically updates the URL after making a change through GitHub online.
You can confirm this under the Repository menu (see Repository settings).

To change the name of your local folder that stores your repo files (not necessary, but probably smart), the easiest option for Windows users seems to be to simply delete the local directory used by Git and clone the repo from GitHub again.
Alternatively, this command will work anywhere:

```
$ git remote set-url origin NEW_URL
```
