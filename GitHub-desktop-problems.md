# Problems using GitHub Desktop

On Windows, it may be necessary to run GitHub Desktop as an administrator to avoid problems accessing or editing files.

1. Find the location of the file that runs GitHub Desktop (Windows key, GitHub, right-click, open location)
2. Right-click on file, select Properties
3. Select Advanced then check "Run as administrator"
